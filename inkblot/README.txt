Overview
---------

This is a prototype of an application to develop lessons in the Association method for the hard of hearing.   Currently it is a very preliminary example of a front end single page emberjs client that supports authentication to a pyramids application.   Left as an exercise for the student is the addition of a signup page, the use of SSL for signin, and the whole Association curriculum.
